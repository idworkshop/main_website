<h1 class="section-heading">
It’s IIW's 20th Anniversary!
</h1>

<p class="section-paragraph">
There’s many reasons for that extraordinary longevity. Here’s the top four:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Growing importance of IWW’s core themes –  identity, privacy, and customer empowerment.
</li>

<li>Enthusiasm of its attendees for addressing those themes.</li>

<li>Unconference format is a wonderful way to get real work done. Please <a href="http://iiw.idcommons.net/IIW_19_Notes">review the notes from IIW XIX</a> to see the topics we discuss.</li>

<li>Attending is exceptionally cost-effective, so IIW delivers a clear ROI.</li>
</ol>

<p class="section-paragraph">
If you'd like a special commemorative T-Shirt to celebrate, you can add one to <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-xx-20-2015a-tickets-14097972415">your registration</a>.

                <p class="lead-iiw section-lead">Why you should come</p>


<p>
You’ll acquire the real-time pulse of a genuinely disruptive marketing movement.
</p>


<p>
IIW brings together the largest concentration on the planet of talent dedicated to empowering customers and moving customer-centric commerce into the mainstream.
</p>


<p>
IIW is at its heart a participatory conference. So at the dozens of sessions and two evening meals (included in ticket) you’ll have plenty of chances to exchange ideas and make new professional connections. 
</p>


	        <p class="section-paragraph">This is the time and place that you get to discuss, share your knowledge, work on and learn about anything & everything related to Internet Idenity today.  </p>

                <h1 class="section-heading">About IIW</h1>
                <p class="lead-iiw section-lead">IIW is an un-conference. It has no keynotes or panels, so it's about getting stuff done.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">The Internet Identity Workshop has been finding, probing and solving identity problems twice every year since 2005. Every IIW moves topics, code and projects downfield. Name an identity topic and it's likely that more substantial discussion and work has been done on it at IIW than at any other conference.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">That's because IIW is an unconference. We have no speakers, no keynotes, no panels. All sessions are breakouts, and the topics are chosen and led by participants.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">And identity is just a starting point. Many other topics come up and move forward as well. In the last few IIWs, hot topics have included personal clouds, privacy, data liberation, transparency, VRM, the Indie Web, the Internet of Things, the Semantic Web, trust frameworks, free and open devices and much more. We also make time and space available for demos.</p>

	      	      <p class="section-paragraph">IIW is cheap, as conferences go. ROI is also maximized by absence of company-driven agendas. Corporate participation is by humble sponsors who like what IIW does for the world — and to supply free meals each day and an all-day espresso bar.</p>

<p class="section-paragraph">IIW takes place over three days every Spring and Fall at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/internet-identity-workshop-xx-20-2015a-tickets-14097972415">Register now</a> for IIW XX on April 7-9. And do it soon, because it's likely to fill up. </p>
